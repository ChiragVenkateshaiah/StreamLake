# StreamLake - Phase 0 Architecture & Scope Lock

This directory contains the Phase-0 architecture and planning documentation for **StreamLake**

Phase-0 exists to clearly define:
- What StreamLake is
- What problems it solves
- What components it contains
- What is explicitly out of scope

Once Phase-0 is finalized, architectural decisions are frozen and all further work focuses only on execution

## What is StreamLake?

StreamLake is a **Kafka-first streaming and lakehouse platform** built on GCP. Kafka acts as the system of record for ingestion, while downstream systems handle storage and orchestration.
